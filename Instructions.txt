(For UBUNTU)

1. Setting up GLFW:

Download GLFW source code from here : https://github.com/glfw/glfw (If you don't already have it)

Unzip, navigate to extracted folder and run the following commands in terminal:

makedir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install

2. Copy the folders present in "include files" directory to your "/use/local/include/".

3. Make sure you have OpenGL and its dependencies installed. (Most of them come pre-installed with linux)

4. Go to "aMaze" directory and compile "aMaze.cpp" from terminal : 

g++ aMaze.cpp  glad.c -o aMaze -lglfw3 -lGL -lX11 -lpthread -lXrandr -lXi -ldl -lstdc++fs

5. ./aMaze


# In case of any compilation error, reach out to me at "astitva.srivastav@research.iiit.ac.in"
